# Typecasting Challenge: Given three variables: `a = ‘100’`, `b = 25`, and `c = ‘10.5’`, write a Python program to perform the following operations and print the results: – Convert `a` to an integer and add it to `b`. – Convert `c` to a float and subtract it from the result of the first operation. – Convert the final result to a string and concatenate it with the string ” is the answer.”

a = '100'
b = 25
c = '10.5'

result1 = int(a) + b
result2 = result1 - float(c)
final_result = f'{result2} is the answer'
print(final_result)

# The final result is printed as a string with the message "is the answer"\
