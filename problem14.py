# Grades Classification: Write a Python program that takes a student’s percentage as input and prints their corresponding grade according to the following criteria: – 90% or above: A+ – 80-89%: A – 70-79%: B – 60-69%: C – Below 60%: Fail
def classify_grade(percentage):
    if percentage >= 90:
        return "A+"
    elif percentage >= 80:
        return "A"
    elif percentage >= 70:
        return "B"
    elif percentage >= 60:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "Fail"
# Example usage

percentage = float(input("Enter the percentage: "))
print(f"The grade is: {classify_grade(percentage)}")
